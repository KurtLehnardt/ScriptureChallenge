<!-- TODO: add the list of scriptures here, paginate maybe 7-10 at a time, or get user input for how many they'd like to read -->
<!--       then render that many scriptures. Might do background API calls to pull in the full scripture data instead of redirecting the link -->
<!--       Google auth -> firebase to save user info? Best way to keep track of which user is at which place? -->
